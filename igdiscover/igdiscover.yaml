## IgDiscover configuration


# How many discovery iterations to run. If 0, no updated database is created,
# but expression profiles are still computed. Unless working with a highly
# incomplete starting database, a single iteration is usually sufficient.
#
iterations: 1


# Type of sequences: Choose 'Ig' or 'TCR'.
#
sequence_type: Ig


## Barcoding settings


# If you have a random barcode sequence (unique molecular identifier) at the 5' end,
# set this to its length. Leave at 0 when you have no 5' barcode.
#
barcode_length_5prime: 0


# Same as above, but for the 3' end of the sequence. Leave at 0 when you have no 3' barcode.
# Currently, you cannot have a barcode in both ends, so at least one of the two settings
# must be zero.
#
barcode_length_3prime: 0


# When barcoding is enabled, sequences that have identical barcode and CDR3 are
# collapsed into a single consensus sequence.
# If you set this to false, no collapsing and consensus taking is done and
# only the barcode is removed from each sequence.
#
barcode_consensus: true


# When grouping by barcode and CDR3, the CDR3 location is either detected with a
# regular expressions or a 'pseudo' CDR3 sequence is used, which is at a
# pre-defined position within the sequence.
#
# Set this configuration option to a region like [-80, -60] to use a pseudo
# CDR3 located at bases 80 to 60 counted from the 3' end. (Use negative numbers to
# count from the 3' end, positive ones to count from the 5' end. The most 5'
# base has index 0.)
#
# Set this to 'detect' (with quotation marks) in order to use CDR3s
# detected by regular expression. This assumes that the input contains
# VH sequences!
#
# Set this to false (no quotation marks) in order to *only* group by barcode, not by CDR3.
#
cdr3_location: 'detect'  # Works only with VH sequences!


# When you use a RACE protocol, then the sequences have a run of G nucleotides in the beginning
# which need to be removed when barcodes are used. If you use RACE, set this to true.
# The G nucleotides are assumed to be in the 5' end (but after the barcode if it exists).
#
race_g: false


## Primer-related settings

# If set to true, it is assumed that the forward primer is always at the 5' end
# of the first read and that the reverse primer is always at the 5' end of the
# second read. If it can also be the other way, set this to false.
# This setting has no effect if no primer sequences are defined below.
#
stranded: false

# List of 5' primers
#
forward_primers:
# - AGCTACAGAGTCCCAGGTCCA
# - ACAGGYGCCCACTCYSAG

# Work only on this number of reads (for quick test runs). Set to false to
# process all reads.
#
#limit: false


# Filter out merged reads that are shorter than this length.
#
minimum_merged_read_length: 300


# Read merging program. Choose either 'pear' or 'flash'.
# pear merges more reads, but is slower.
#
#merge_program: pear


# Maximum overlap (-M) for the flash read merger.
# If you use pear, this is ignored.
#
flash_maximum_overlap: 300


# Do not mention the original FASTA or FASTQ sequence names in the
# assigned.tab files, but instead use names <analysis_directory_name>_seq<number>,
# where <number> is a running number starting at 1.
#  true: yes, rename
#  false: no, do not rename
#
rename: false


# Whether debugging is enabled or not. Currently, if this is set to true,
# some large intermediate files that would otherwise be deleted will be
# kept.
#
debug: false


# The "seed value" is in arbitrary number used to get reproducible
# runs. Two runs that use the same software version, the same seed
# and otherwise the same configuration will give identical results.
#
# Set this to false in order to use a different seed each run.
# The results will then be not exactly reproducible.
#
seed: 1


# The preprocessing filter is always applied directly after running IgBLAST,
# even if no gene discovery is requested.
#
preprocessing_filter:
  v_coverage: 90   # Match must cover V gene by at least this percentage
  j_coverage: 60   # Match must cover J gene by at least this percentage
  v_evalue: 0.001  # Highest allowed V gene match E-value


## Candidate discovery settings

# When discovering new V genes, ignore whether a J gene has been assigned
# and also ignore its %SHM.
#  true: yes, ignore the J
#  false: do not ignore J assignment, do not ignore its %SHM
#
ignore_j: false


# When clustering sequences to discover new genes, subsample to this number of
# sequences. Higher is slower.
#
subsample: 1000


# When computing the Ds_exact column, consider only D hits that
# cover the reference D gene sequence by at least this percentage.
#
d_coverage: 70


## V candidate filtering (germline filtering) settings


# Filtering criteria applied to candidate sequences in all iterations except the last.
#

  maximum_database_difference: 0

## J discovery settings

j_discovery:
  allele_ratio: 0.2         # Required minimum ratio between alleles of a single gene
